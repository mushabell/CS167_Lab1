  The name of the directory is abell062_lab1, or the person's netID followed by "_lab1"

- ***(Q3) Which of the following is the right way to call the `IsEven` function?***

    - IsEven(5)
    - IsEven.apply(5)
    - new IsEven().apply(5)\
      IsEven(5) is not the correct way to call the function because to use the function we need to use the apply(5). \
      IsEven.apply(5) is not the correct way to call the function because to use the function we need to create an object using the key word new. \
      new IsEven().apply(5) is the right way to call the function because this creates a new object and calls the function through apply.

  No, the code did not complie after adding the 'base=0' line.
